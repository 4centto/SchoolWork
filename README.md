# COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEERING AT UNAM

Here's my repo where you could find my school works at UNAM, like homeworks, projects, and notes that I took in class.
Also, and the most important, there's also a folder where there are my practicing at coding some projects, and in every language that I've been learned, like Python, Java, C, C++, C#, HTML, JavaScript, etc.
